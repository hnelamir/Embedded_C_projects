# 🔌 Embedded C Projects Repository

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a collection of Embedded C projects designed to develop and enhance low-level programming skills for microcontrollers and embedded systems.

## 🎯 Purpose
- ✅ Practice Embedded C programming with real-world applications.
- ✅ Implement projects that interface with hardware components.
- ✅ Develop efficient and optimized low-level code.
- ✅ Gain hands-on experience with microcontrollers and embedded peripherals.

## 📂 Projects Included
This repository includes various Embedded C projects covering topics like:
- ⚡ GPIO control and interfacing
- 📡 Communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN)
- ⏳ Timers and interrupts
- 🔢 ADC and PWM applications
- 🛠️ Bare-metal programming

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
1. 📥 Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hnelamir/Embedded_C_projects.git
   ```
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory.
3. 🛠️ Compile using an embedded toolchain (e.g., GCC for ARM, AVR-GCC, etc.).
4. 🔄 Flash the compiled binary onto the target microcontroller.
5. 📊 Test and validate functionality with hardware.

## 🔧 Requirements
- 🔍 Microcontroller development board (e.g., STM32, AVR, PIC, ESP32, etc.)
- 🛠️ Embedded C toolchain (GCC, Keil, IAR, etc.)
- 🔌 Debugging tools (JTAG, SWD, Serial Monitor)
